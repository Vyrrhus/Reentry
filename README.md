# Reentry

This repository aims to plot & simulate various atmospheric reentry from upper space, i.e. balistic reentry, lifting reentry, orbital decay.
It tries to be a first-handed simulation model so that one can get quickly the few parameters needed to characterize such a flight.
For now, it's only plotting & simulating a bunch of graphs, but it should be improved adding modules so that the planetary conditions, the vehicle parameters & the flight boundary conditions may be changed.
